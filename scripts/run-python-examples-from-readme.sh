# Script to run Python examples from README.md and examples/python/README.md files
# Usage: ./scripts/run-python-examples-from-readme.sh [TARGET]
#
# TARGET - Optional target architecture (e.g., x86_64-unknown-linux-musl)
#          If not provided, uses the default target
#
# This script will run all the commands from both README.md and examples/python/README.md files
# and check if they pass or fail.
# If any command fails, it will print the command and exit with non-zero status.
# If all commands pass, it will remove the log file and exit with zero status.
#
# Note: This script assumes that the iggy-server is not running and will start it in the background.
#       It will wait until the server is started before running the commands.
#       It will also terminate the server after running all the commands.
#       Script executes every command in README files which is enclosed in backticks (`) and starts
#       with `python `. Other commands are ignored.
#       Order of commands in README files is important as script will execute them from top to bottom.
